# Feature Implementation Prompt

This prompt is designed to gather all necessary information for implementing a new feature. Please provide as much detail as possible to ensure a comprehensive and accurate implementation.

## 1. Feature Overview

*   **Feature Name:** A concise name for the new feature.
*   **Brief Description:** Explain the purpose of this feature and what problem it solves or what value it adds.
*   **User Story/Use Case:** Describe how a user will interact with this feature. (e.g., "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]")

## 2. Scope and Deliverables

*   **In-Scope:** What functionalities are definitely part of this feature?
*   **Out-of-Scope:** What functionalities are explicitly NOT part of this feature (to avoid scope creep)?
*   **Deliverables:** What are the expected outputs or results of implementing this feature? (e.g., new API endpoint, UI component, database changes, updated documentation)

## 3. Functional Requirements

List the specific functionalities the feature must provide. Be as detailed as possible.

*   **Requirement 1:** [Description of requirement]
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** [How will we know this requirement is met?]
*   **Requirement 2:** ...

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (Optional)

*   **Performance:** (e.g., "Response time for X action must be under 200ms")
*   **Security:** (e.g., "All user data must be encrypted at rest")
*   **Scalability:** (e.g., "Must support 10,000 concurrent users")
*   **Usability:** (e.g., "User interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate")
*   **Compatibility:** (e.g., "Must work on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari")

## 5. Technical Considerations (Optional)

*   **Existing Components:** Are there any existing components, libraries, or services that should be leveraged or integrated with?
*   **New Technologies:** Are there any new technologies, frameworks, or tools that might be required or preferred for this feature?
*   **Architecture Impact:** How might this feature impact the existing system architecture?
*   **Data Model Changes:** If database changes are required, describe them (new tables, columns, relationships).

## 6. Design and User Interface (if applicable)

*   **Wireframes/Mockups:** If available, describe or attach links to any UI/UX designs.
*   **User Flow:** Describe the steps a user will take to interact with the feature.
*   **Visual Elements:** Any specific styling, branding, or visual requirements.

## 7. Testing and Verification

*   **Testing Strategy:** What kind of testing is expected (unit, integration, end-to-end, manual, automated)?
*   **Test Cases (Optional):** Provide any specific test cases or scenarios that should be covered.

## 8. Dependencies and Blockers

*   **Internal Dependencies:** Are there other teams or modules within the project that this feature depends on?
*   **External Dependencies:** Are there any external services or APIs required?
*   **Potential Blockers:** Any known issues or challenges that might hinder implementation?

## 9. Desired Output Format

*   What kind of output would you prefer for the feature implementation? (e.g., code changes, detailed plan, architectural diagrams, test reports)
