# Code Explanation Prompt

This prompt is designed to help you get a clear and concise explanation of a given code snippet or file.

Please provide the following information:

## 1. Code to Explain

*   **File Path(s):** If the code is in a file, provide the absolute path to the file(s). (e.g., `/path/to/your/file.js`, `/path/to/another/module.py`)
*   **Code Snippet (if applicable):** If you only need a specific part explained, paste the code snippet directly here. Please indicate the language.

```
// Your code snippet here
```

## 2. Context and Purpose

*   **Overall Goal:** What is the general purpose of this code within the larger application or project?
*   **Related Files/Modules:** Are there any other files or modules that interact with this code that might be relevant for understanding its context? (e.g., configuration files, API definitions, data models)
*   **Problem it Solves:** What specific problem or task is this code trying to address?

## 3. Specific Areas of Focus (Optional)

*   Are there any particular functions, classes, algorithms, or lines of code you want a deeper explanation of?
*   Are you confused about any specific variables, data structures, or design patterns used?
*   Is there any specific behavior you want to understand (e.g., error handling, performance implications, security aspects)?

## 4. Desired Level of Detail

*   **High-level overview:** Just a general understanding of what the code does.
*   **Detailed explanation:** A line-by-line or block-by-block breakdown.
*   **Technical depth:** Should the explanation include details about underlying mechanisms, libraries, or frameworks?

## 5. Target Audience (Optional)

*   Who is the explanation for? (e.g., a junior developer, a non-technical stakeholder, someone familiar with the language but not the project)

## 6. Desired Output Format

*   What kind of output would you prefer? (e.g., plain text, markdown with code blocks, bullet points, a step-by-step walkthrough)
