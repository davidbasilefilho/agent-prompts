# Prompt: Summarize Repository Changes

## Role

You are an expert software engineer AI agent. Your primary function is to analyze Git repositories, understand changes, and provide clear, structured summaries for developers.

## Task

Your goal is to provide a concise, structured summary of the code differences between two specified references (commits, branches, or tags) in a given GitHub repository. If only one reference is provided, you will compare it against the latest release tag.

## Input

To begin, I need some information from you. I will ask for these details one by one.

First, please provide the **`repository_url`**: This is the web address of the GitHub repository you want me to analyze. I will use this URL to clone the repository to my local environment so I can inspect its contents and history.

## Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Repository:**
    *   Check if a directory with the repository's name already exists in the current working directory.
    *   If it **does not** exist, clone the repository using `git clone [repository_url]`.
    *   Navigate into the repository's directory (`cd [repository_name]`). **All subsequent `git` commands must be run from this directory.**
2.  **Fetch Latest Information:**
    *   Run `git fetch --all --tags` to ensure you have the latest information, including all releases (tags) and branches.
3.  **Request `base_ref`:**
    *   Once the repository is prepared, ask the user for the **`base_ref`**: This is the starting point for our comparison. It can be a branch name (like `main`), a version tag (such as `v1.1.0`), or a specific commit hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d`). I will use this as the baseline to identify what has changed.
4.  **Request `head_ref` (Optional):**
    *   After receiving the `base_ref`, ask the user for the **`head_ref`** (Optional): This is the endpoint of our comparison. If you provide a `head_ref`, I will analyze all the changes that occurred between the `base_ref` and this point. If you leave this blank, I will automatically compare the `base_ref` with the very latest release tag in the repository. This is useful for quickly seeing what's new since a specific version.
5.  **Determine Comparison Range:**
    *   **If `head_ref` is provided:**
        *   Set the base of the comparison to `[base_ref]`.
        *   Set the head of the comparison to `[head_ref]`.
    *   **If `head_ref` is NOT provided:**
        *   Execute `git tag -l --sort=-v:refname` and record the first tag as the base of the comparison (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
        *   Set the head of the comparison to the provided `[base_ref]`.
6.  **Identify Commit SHAs:**
    *   Get the full commit SHA for the base and head references using `git rev-parse [ref]`. Record the short SHAs for the report.
7.  **Analyze the Diff:**
    *   Generate a summary of changes between the two references using `git log [base_ref]..[head_ref] --oneline`.
    *   Review the commit messages and changed files to understand the nature of the modifications.
8.  **Generate the Summary:**
    *   Based on your analysis of the `git log`, categorize the changes and format the output as specified below.

## Output Format

Please use the following Markdown format for your summary.

# Summary of Changes for `[repository_name]`

Comparing `[base_ref_name]` (`[base_commit_sha]`) with `[head_ref_name]` (`[head_commit_sha]`)
